# Real Time Bus Tracker
This was one of my assignments for MIT XPRO course for Week 9. I am still working on adding some styles and features to this page. The main purpose of this repository is to learn and get comfortable pulling data and interacting with the DOM.
## Miami Bus Tracker for Palmetto Bay and Pinecrest
The markers represent the bus stops along its route as it travels up the US1 South Dixie Highway.
## Future Improvements
I plan on adding a couple of neat features to this. Alterations to the mapanimation.js file need to be made to have the button flash at a different speed than the bus from stop to stop. I also need to modify the styles.css and index.html file in order to add some styling and classes as I play with colors and fonts on the page to make it more unique and engaging.

# Real Time Bus Tracker
This was one of my assignments for MIT XPRO course for Week 9. I am still working on adding some styles and features to this page. The main purpose of this repository is to learn and get comfortable pulling data and interacting with the DOM.
## Miami Bus Tracker for Palmetto Bay and Pinecrest
The markers represent the bus stops along its route as it travels up the US1 South Dixie Highway.
## Future Improvements
I plan on adding a list that displays the the location of the bus as it travels along its route, as well as the most recent stop that it has made.
